This test provides a dissipative dynamics for the isolated LiCN molecule (no external field) with 4 states.
The seed.dat file contains the seed values for 1000 trajectories.
The script_local script runs 1000 trajectories locally; seed is drawn randomly (to use the list in seed.dat, a modification of the script is needed).
The script_hydra does the same job on hydra.
the run produces 1000 directories. Using inp_pop (for the populations) and inp_dec (for the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix) with do_mean.x, averages are computed, provided a tmp.dat file (obtained as paste */c_t* > tmp.dat for the population and paste */d_t* > tmp.dat for the off-diagonal elements).
New files for the dissipation are:

 sp_rate.inp gets the spontaneous emission decay rate for each CIS state.
 nr_rate.inp gets the non-radiative decay rate for each CIS state.
 de_rate.inp gets the dephasing decay rate for each CIS state.
 de_phase.inp gets the dephasing term for each CIS state.

In this test, the nr and de channels are turned on.
WARNING: one can obtain EXACTLY the same results collected in /out ONLY using the list of seed values in seed.dat.
