Run: 
embem.x < inputfile > outputfile

Procedure 

1) Generate cavity and matrices:
 -cavity.inp generated by GAMESS or generated by embem.x with inputfile=tdcis_nano_write_cav.inp
 -mat_SD.inp generated by embem.x with inputfile=tdcis_nano_write.inp or inputfile=tdcis_nano_write_cav.inp

2) Propagation with embem.x and inputfile=tdcis_nano.inp
