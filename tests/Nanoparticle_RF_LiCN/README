Run: 
WaveT < inputfile > outputfile

Procedure 

1) Generate cavity and matrices:
 -cavity.inp generated by GAMESS or generated by WaveT with inputfile=tdcis_nanoparticle_write.inp
 -mat_SD.inp generated by WaveT with inputfile=tdcis_nanoparticle_write.inp                              

2) Propagation with embem.x and inputfile=tdcis_nanoparticle_LF.inp
