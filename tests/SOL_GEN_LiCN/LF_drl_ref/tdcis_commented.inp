&general n_ci=5,n_ci_read=5	!n_ci: number of CI states to be used in the TD-CIS propagation, n_ci_read: number of CI states calculated; energies and matrix elements of potentials and dipoles corresponding to the latter CI states are stored in ci_energy.inp, ci_pot.inp, ci_mut.inp, respectively.   
mol_cc= 0. 0. 0.		!mol_cc: molecular center of charges of the molecule. It is used for the calculation of the dipole and electrostatic field in the case of Onsager and PCM-mu models. 
medium='sol'			!medium: type of external medium. Here a solvent ('sol') is selected. Other possible choice is a nanoparticle ('nan'). 
n_f=1				!n_f: integer to be appended in all output files to distinguish trajectories in an Stochastic Schrodinger Equation run. The default value is n_f=1 and can be omitted from input namelist.
dt=0.20				!dt: time step of the time-dependent propagation
n_step=5000			!n_step: total number of steps in time-dependent propagation
n_out=1				!n_out: output files are written each n_out steps of the time-dependent propagation 
/ 

&field
Ffld='snd'			!Ffld: type of function. A linearly modulated sinusoid ('snd') is selected here. Other possible choice is a Gaussian ('gau') and a pi pulse ('pip').
omega(1)=0.5			!omega: frequency of the sinusoid
sigma(1)=10.,			!sigma: full-(time)width at half maximum of the pulse. Not used for Ffld='snd'.
t_mid=500			!t_mid: time after which the linear envelope is replaced by a one
radiative='non'			!radiative: flag for a possible stochastic field. In this run none ('non') is selected.
npulse=1			!npulse: number of pulses
fmax(1,1) = 0.			!fmax: amplitude of the pulse. (1,_), (2,_) and (3,_) are the x, y and z components.
fmax(2,1) = 0. 
fmax(3,1)=0.000001

&PROPAGATE  
propagation_type='ief'		!propagation_type: flag defining the quantity to be propagated. 'ief' means that polarization charges are propagated following the equation of motion in Eq. (37) from [J. Phys. Chem. A 2015, 119, 5405-5416]. 
interaction_type='pcm'		!interaction_type: kind interaction of the molecule with the external medium. For the Onsager ('ons') model, the reaction field is considered uniform in space and hence the interaction is dipolar, i.e., $-\vec{\mu} \dot \vec{F}_{RF}$, where $\vec{\mu}$ is the molecular dipole and $F_{RF}$ is the reaction field of the external medium. The other possible choice is PCM ('pcm'), for which the interaction is $\int d\mathbf{r} \rho(\mathbf{r}) V_{RF}(\mathbf{r})=\sum_i q_i*V_{\rho}(\mathbf{r}_i)$, where $\rho$ and $V_{\rho}$ is the molecular density and the potential generated by it. $V_{RF}$ is the reaction potential and $\{q_i\}$ are the apparent surface charges at the tesserae points (either in the cavity or in the surface of the nanoparticle, depending on the external medium). PCM selection is incompatible with propagation_type='dip'.
interaction_stride=1		!interaction_stride: molecule-medium interaction is updated each interaction_stride steps of the time-dependent propagation. It is only working for propagation_type='dip' and interaction_type='ons'.
interaction_init='non-scf'	!interaction_init: determine the starting state and polarization charges of the simulation. The default value interaction_init='non-scf' means that the the initial charges are calculated for the ground state. In the default case, the initial state is not in equilibrium with the polarization of the medium unless the initial state is the ground state. interaction_init='scf' means that the reaction potential is equilibrated with the initial state. 
test_type='s-l'			!test_type: differen options for testing. 's-l' option allow to check the local field inside the cavity when the external medium is a solvent. It writes in medium_t_1.dat file a reference value for the local field effect in the case of a uniform electric field applied and a spherical cavity. 
local_field='loc'		!local_field: determine wether local field effects are considered ('loc') or not ('non'). This calculation uses local field effects.
/

&MEDIUM
medium_type='sol'		!medium_type: (as in medium) type of external medium. Here a solvent ('sol') is selected. Other possible choice is a nanoparticle ('nan').  
medium_init='vac'		!medium_init: how to initialize the medium polarization. Here is selected 'vac', meaning that the initial polarization is zero (as in vacuum).  
bem_type='diag'
bem_read_write='rea'
/

&SURFACE			!surface: namelist controlling the tesselation of the cavity or nanoparticle surface, depending on the external medium 
input_surface='fil'		!input_surface: flag determining if the cavity tesselation is build ('bui') from interlocking spheres or read from file. 'fil' option means that the cavity is read from cavity.inp file.
/

&EPS_FUNCTION			!eps_function: namelist defining the dielectric function
epsilon_omega='deb'		!epsilon_omega: determine the dielectric model. Here the Debye ('deb') model is used. The other choice is Drude-Lorentz ('drl').
eps_0=35.688			!eps_0 ($\epsilon_0$), eps_d ($\epsilon_d$), tau_deb ($\tau_D$) are the parameters entering in the dielectric function, i.e., $\epsilon(omega) = \epsilon_d + (\epsilon_0-\epsilon_d)/(1-i\omega\tau_D)$
eps_d=1.18       
tau_deb=500. 
!tau_deb=139320.
