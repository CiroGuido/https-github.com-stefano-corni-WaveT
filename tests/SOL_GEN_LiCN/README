Reproducing approximately the reaction and local field effects for a solvent described by a Drude-Lorentz dielectric function with the approach for general dielectric functions

WARNING The test for Debye dielectric function doesn't work because the approach for general dielectric function fails. There are no poles of PCM response matrix in this case, as can be seen from figure check.png (generated by gnuplot.sh). 

N.B. The only working propagation_type and interaction_type keyword combination that works is ief and pcm, respectively.
