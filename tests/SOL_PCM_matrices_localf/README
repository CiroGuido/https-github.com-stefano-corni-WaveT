Test to output PCM matrices (including those for the local field) in the case of an spherical cavity embedded in a solvent

Step 1. Build-up the cavity:

It is run as

../../TDPlas/bin/tdplas.x < cavity_and_SDmatrices_builder.inp > cavity_and_SDmatrices_builder.out

It generates

cavity.inp   <- cavity input - TDPlas format
np_bem.cav   <- cavity - GAMESS format
mat_SD.inp   <- S and D matrices

Step 2. Build-up the PCM matrices (including those for the local field)

It is run as

../../TDPlas/bin/tdplas.x < pcmmatrices_builder.inp > pcmmatrices_builder.out

It generates

np_bem.mat <- static PCM response matrix - GAMESS format
np_bem.mdy <- dynamic PCM response matrix - GAMESS format
np_bem.mlf <- analogous to np_bem.mat for the local field
np_bem.mld <- analogous to np_bem.mdy for the local field
