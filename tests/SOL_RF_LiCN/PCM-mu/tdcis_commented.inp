&field
Ffld='pip'			!Ffld: type of function. Pi pulse ('pip') is selected here. Other possible choice is a Gaussian ('gau'). The time-dependent electric field corresponding to the pi pulse is defined in Eq.(29) of J. Chem. Phys. 146, 064116 (2016).
omega(1)=0.262961		!omega: central frequency in the spectral decomposition of the pulse
sigma(1)=20,			!sigma: full-(time)width at half maximum of the pulse
t_mid=250			!t_mid: central time of the pulse
radiative='non'			!radiative: flag for a possible stochastic field. In this run none ('non') is selected.
npulse=1			!npulse: number of pulses
fmax(1,1) = 0.			!fmax: amplitude of the pulse. Selecting 0. means actually no pulse is used. (1,_), (2,_) and (3,_) are the x, y and z components.
fmax(2,1) = 0. 
fmax(3,1) = 0.

&PROPAGATE  
propagation_type='ief'		!propagation_type: flag defining the quantity to be propagated. 'dip' means that the reaction field is propagated within the Onsager model (ASCs are not used). 'dip' refer to keeping the dipolar approximation of the molecule-medium interaction energy. Other possible choices are 'ief' and 'ied' whose equations of motion are in Eqs. (37) and (41) (version of (37) with a single relaxation time) from [J. Phys. Chem. A 2015, 119, 5405-5416]. 
interaction_type='pcm'		!interaction_type: kind interaction of the molecule with the external medium. For the Onsager ('ons') model, the reaction field is considered uniform in space and hence the interaction is dipolar, i.e., $-\vec{\mu} \dot \vec{F}_{RF}$, where $\vec{\mu}$ is the molecular dipole and $F_{RF}$ is the reaction field of the external medium. The other possible choice is PCM ('pcm'), for which the interaction is $\int d\mathbf{r} \rho(\mathbf{r}) V_{RF}(\mathbf{r})=\sum_i q_i*V_{\rho}(\mathbf{r}_i)$, where $\rho$ and $V_{\rho}$ is the molecular density and the potential generated by it. $V_{RF}$ is the reaction potential and $\{q_i\}$ are the apparent surface charges at the tesserae points (either in the cavity or in the surface of the nanoparticle, depending on the external medium). PCM selection is incompatible with propagation_type='dip'.
interaction_stride=1		!interaction_stride: molecule-medium interaction is updated each interaction_stride steps of the time-dependent propagation. It is only working for propagation_type='dip' and interaction_type='ons'.
interaction_init='non-scf'	!interaction_init: determine the starting state and polarization charges of the simulation. The default value interaction_init='non-scf' means that the the initial charges are calculated for the ground state. In the default case, the initial state is not in equilibrium with the polarization of the medium unless the initial state is the ground state. interaction_init='scf' means that the reaction potential is equilibrated with the initial state. 
test_type='s-r'			!test_type: differen options for testing. 's-r' option allow to check the solvent reaction field when the external medium is a solvent. It writes in medium_t_1.dat file a reference value for the reaction field in the case of a point-like dipole moment in the center of an spherical cavity. 
debug_type='vmu'		!debug_type: different options for debug. 'vmu' refers to the calculation of the molecular potential from the dipole.
local_field='non'		!local_field: determine wether local field effects are considered ('loc') or not ('non'). The default is 'non'.
/

&MEDIUM
medium_type='sol'		!medium_type: (as in medium) type of external medium. Here a solvent ('sol') is selected. Other possible choice is a nanoparticle ('nan').  
medium_init='vac'		!medium_init: how to initialize the medium polarization. Here is selected 'vac', meaning that the initial polarization is zero (as in vacuum). 
!bem_type='diag'
!bem_read_write='rea'
/

&SURFACE			!surface: namelist controlling the tesselation of the cavity or nanoparticle surface, depending on the external medium 
!input_surface='fil'
spheres_number=1		!spheres_number: number of spheres composing the cavity or the nanoparticle 
sphere_position_x= 0.		!sphere_position_x: center of the latter spheres. _x, _y, _z define the x, y, z components of the centers.
sphere_position_y= 0.
sphere_position_z= 0.
sphere_radius= 10.		!sphere_radius: radius of the spheres
/

&EPS_FUNCTION			!eps_function: namelist defining the dielectric function
epsilon_omega='deb'		!epsilon_omega: determine the dielectric model. Here the Debye ('deb') model is used. The other choice is Drude-Lorentz ('drl').
eps_0=35.688			!eps_0 ($\epsilon_0$), eps_d ($\epsilon_d$), tau_deb ($\tau_D$) are the parameters entering in the dielectric function, i.e., $\epsilon(omega) = \epsilon_d + (\epsilon_0-\epsilon_d)/(1-i\omega\tau_D)$
eps_d=1.18       
tau_deb=500. 
!tau_deb=139320.
