SSE simulations should usually include a large number of independent trajectories. Remember to use different seeds for different runs. Here only one trajectory is reported as an example.


In case of "full" relaxation the order of relaxation decay rates in sp_rate.inp and nr_rate.inp is the following:
 1) first n_ci values are k -> 0 relaxations (k=1,n_ci);
 2) the following values are for k -> j relaxations, with k=n_ci,1 and j=k-1,1.
