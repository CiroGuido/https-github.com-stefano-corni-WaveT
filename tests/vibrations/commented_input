Input:

nstates            number of orginal eletronic states
nvib=3             number of vibrational levels per normal mode
nmodes=1           number of normal modes
coupling=.false.   Herzeberg-Teller term (not implemnted yet)    
mix=.false.        Duschinsky matrix (not implemented yet)
nfc=1              Power for <v'|x^nfc|v>
emax=8.            Maxmimum energy (eV) for vibronic spectrum
nbin=10000         Number of bins for energy grid for the vibroni spectrum
sigma=10.5         Gaussian sigma for doing the spectrum


vib.dat contains, for each electronic state and normal mode, frequency (in cm-1) and normal coordinate (au). The structure is

   el state   number of normal modes
   frequency(1)   coord(1)
     ...           ...

WARNING: the number of normal modes is always the same for any electronic state
